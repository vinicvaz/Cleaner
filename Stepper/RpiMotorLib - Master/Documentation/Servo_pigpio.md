Hardware
------------------------------------

Should Work on any servo with 20mS duty cycle or 50Hz frequency, tested on.

* Tower pro Digital micro servo SG90 
* Hitec HS422 servo
* Tower pro MG996R Servo

(Check if your servo has a range of 0-180 degrees and 
matches the freq/duty cycle specifications, most should)

[Datasheet SG90](http://www.micropik.com/PDF/SG90Servo.pdf)
[Datasheet Hs422](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/hs422-31422S.pdf)
[Datasheet MG996R](http://www.datasheetcafe.com/mg996r-datasheet-digital-servo/)

The following HW description applies to the ultra common SG90 servo.

The servo has 3 wires one for gnd(brown) 5v power(red) and signal(orange/yellow).  
I have verified that it is safe to drive a single servo from the 5 volt rail on Rpi.
However It is possible to damage your Raspberry Pi by drawing 
too much current out of a pin(spikes or low current power supply on the pi). 
It is best to power it from a 5 Volt source other than a Raspberry Pi rail. 
You can still control it from the Raspberry Pi if you use a common ground, 
but just get the power (red wire) from an external source. 
The Pi draws approximately 700 mA from the +5 V supply. You may draw current from the +5 V pins provided 
the sum of that current and the board's 700 mA doesn't exceed the supply you provide to the board. 

From the data sheet , we see these servos expects a frequency of 50 Hz 
on the control line and the position it moves to depends on the pulse width of the signal.
50Hz gives a period of 20mS (Freq = 1/Period)

These servo has a range of 180 degrees.

The Raspberry Pi controls the servo by outputting a PWM signal of varying 
duty cycle on a GPIO pin connected to signal pin of servo.

Duty Cycle = Pulse Width * Frequency

Given a 50 Hz frequency we can calculate the required duty cycle for any pulse width.

Excepted values of pulse width  for many standard servos are
1. 1.5 ms pulse( to center the servo or 0 or 90 degrees or center postion)
2. 1 ms pulse (- 90 degrees or 0 degrees or "min postion ") 
3. 2 ms pulse (+ 90 degrees or 180 or "max postion ")

Note: 1mS = 1000uS The pigpio module uses Pulse width in microseconds
So the  SW methods take uS as parameters.

However every servo is different, so you will need to calibrate it for the best performance.
Check datasheet for recommend pulse width and calibrate accordingly.
Some cheap hobby servos can vary widely.
The software will only accept values from 500-2500uS or 0 in event of turning "off".

The software includes a method to convert degrees to pulse width in uS.
for user convenience, this method is also used internally in one of the other methods
If user prefers working in degrees they can pass result to the other methods
which want pulse duty cycle percentage.

This method works as follows imagine we have two points on a graph. 
(x1, y1) (x2, y2). 
Where 1 is servo right position 0 degree. 
Where 2 is servo left position  180 degree. 
Where x is degree and y is pulse width. 
Y 1 and Y2 are calibrated by user = default (1000, 2000). 

(x1 , y1) = ( 0,1000 )  
(x2, y2) =  (180,2000).

To get slope of line m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).
The equation of the line using the point slope formula = y-y1=m(x-x1) .
We want to find point (x,y)
Where y is required pulse width and x is the given degree.
For default values this works out as PulseWidth = 5.55555*(DesiredAngle) + 1000.

So for default values 90 degree or midpoint is 1500. 

 
Software for Servo by pigpio library
--------------------------------------------

Remember to start to pigpio daemon every time you want to use it or at
startup. By typing sudo pigpiod.

The library file rpi_pservo_lib.py has a single class 
which controls the servo 

The class is called ServoPigpio and it contains four methods:

(1) servo_sweep - sets up a continuous sweep from two points
Center-wait-min-wait-max-wait-min- and so on until user quits or set limit reached.

(2) servo_move - moves to a specified location in a single sweep

(3) convert_from_degree - converts degrees to pulse width 

(4) servo_move_step - moves servo from two points in timed steps.


### Import library and intialise the class 

```sh
from RpiMotorLib import rpi_pservo_lib
myservotest  = rpi_pservo_lib.ServoPigpio("Sone", 50, 1000, 2000)
```

The class takes four parameters on init
1. name, type=string, default=servoY,  
2. Freq, type=int, default=50, help=control freq of servo in Hz
3. y_one, type=float, default = 1000 ,help=pulse width min in uS of servo % for 0 degrees
4. y_two type=float, default = 2000 , help=pulse width max in uS of servo % for 180 degrees

y_one and y-two are used by methods numbered 3 and 4. 

### 1 - servo_sweep

function, servo_sweep, 8 inputs
sets up asweep from two points, 
Center-delay-min-delay-max-delay- and so on until user quits or set-limit reached.

 (2) center, type=float, default=1500,
 help=The center pulse width position of servo in uS.

```sh

# call the function pass by value in this case.
